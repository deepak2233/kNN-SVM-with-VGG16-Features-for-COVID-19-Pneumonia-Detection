    "- **Combining kNN and SVM:** By incorporating the local neighborhood information from kNN \n",
    "  into the global margin optimization of SVM, the kNN-SVM classifier benefits from both:\n",
    "  - **Local Sensitivity (kNN):** Ensures that the decision boundary is sensitive to the local \n",
